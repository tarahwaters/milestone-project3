# cafeworks â˜•
# - a full stack web application to share cafe recommendations suitable for remote working

------

**cafeworks** is a web application that allows user to view and recommend their favourite cafes that are suitable for remote working.

It can often be difficult to find the right cafe which offers us everything we need for working / studying remotely - e.g. a free and reliable wifi connection, power outlets for charging laptops and devices, comfortable seating, and good quality food and drink options for refueling are also important!

This app aims to provide a platform where users can share their favourite remote working cafes, and hopefully inpire other cafeworking digital nomads who love to travel and explore the world while they work!

### Target Audience

The target audience of this web application are anyone who is interested in exploring cafe options for remote work or study around the world. By sharing a cafe suggestion, they are helping to build an online community of cafelovers and remote workers. It might be that the user is on holiday or travelling while they work or study, or they are looking to explore new cafes in their neighbourhood.. hopefully this app will provide some great cafe recommendations that will inspire and satisy their needs.

## Scope
### Trade Offs

Considering the user requirements and expectations, the table below shows the features that should be implemented to make an appealing and functional interactive game for users. Due to time constraints and my current skill level, some of these features are not implemented at this stage.

[X] indicates opportunities that were considered at the planning stage but were deemed not viable/feasible for this project sprint.
Y / N indicates a Yes / No as to whether each opportunity was acheived and implemented at this stage.

| Opportunity                                                      | Importance | Viability / Feasibility | Outcome |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------: | :---------------------: | :------:|
| Card-matching memory game that works by user clicking cards      |     5      |            5            |    Y    |
| Timer and move counter that provide up-to-date feedback to user  |     5      |            5            |    Y    |
| HowToPlay modal with set of instructions (with clickable button) |     5      |            5            |    Y    |
| WinMessage modal that pops up when user has completed the game   |     5      |            5            |    Y    |
| Option to restart (with button on main page, also via Win modal) |     5      |            5            |    Y    |
| Access to summary notes page for revision / download afer game   |     3      |            4            |    Y    |
| Option of advanced level / challenge                             |     3      |            2            |    N    |

### Future Features

- **Future Feature 1**
    - The infocards have already been designed with the potential to include 3 separate details to test learning of specialised cells knowledge (required for the GCSE Biology curriculum) - function / location / features. There could be increased difficulties levels where descriptions contain more complex information, or more cell types could be added as a bonus challenge.

- **Future Feature 2**
    - There could be an option to also add more revision topics to the game so the user can improve their knowledge in other areas of the curriculum.

- **Future Feature 3**
    - Sound effects could be added for when cards are clicked, flipped, matched or not matched. This could be more fun and engaging for the user, and also gives them instant feedback of success or error which may improve learning. This feature could be made optional for when the user prefers a quiet game.

- **Future Feature 4**
    - Details of some issues regarding responsiveness are detailed in the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file and these would be worked on in future development. Adding more cell cards as options for the game, could allow the grid layout to be changed (e.g. maximum 3x6 instead of 4x4) to optimise card readability. In future, it may be preferable to also use a responsive grid framework (from Boostrap for example) to avoid some of the issues I faced during styling.

- **Future Feature 5** 
    - Although this was not flagged up as an error during testing, it was considered a warning (and as feedback from user testing). The red/blue colour combination of backfaces for the function cards, may be redesigned for future. Currently, it does not affect readability of the 'Function' name, but may be slightly straining for the eyes. Perhaps an option could be included to toggle between different colour schemes for the game depending on the user's preference or needs.

## Skeleton

Wireframes for the website were created using the UI wireframe tool, [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), to plan the layout across desktop, tablet and mobile devices.

The layout and design was kept consistent across the pages / devices as much as possible.

The main game page consists of:

- A title
- A subtitle description of the game
- A countdown timer is on the top left corner ofthe gamegrid - displays how many seconds are remaining during a game
- A moves counter that is on the top right corner of the gamegrid - displays the number of moves made during a game
- A gamegrid of separated into x2 8 divs displaying the rear side of the cards - two cards can be flipped over at a time to make a match
- A reset button is underneath the gamegrid - gives the user the option to reset the game to the beginning
- A howtoplay button is underneath the gamegrid - gives the user the option to view the game instructions and access the prelearning material
- A footer which contains a copyright statement

### Wireframes

These were the initial wireframes created for the project during the planning stage:

**1. Wireframes 1**

## Surface

### Logo

The cafeworks logo was created using [Canva](https://canva.com/).

![cafeworks logo](/documentation/readme/cafeworks-logo.png "cafeworks logo")

### Color Scheme

[coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) was used to create a color palette for the design.

![cafeworks colorscheme](/documentation/readme/cafeworks-colors.png "cafeworks colorscheme")

### Typography

[canva.com](https://canva.com/) was used to create a logo from a template and their default font pairing was used from **Canva's 'Ultimate Guide to Font Pairing'**.

"**League Spartan** is a modern typeface with strong structure and geometric form. This contrasts well against the elegant and more traditional style of **Libre Baskerville**. Using a serif for your body copy makes dense information easy to read." - from [Canva Ultimate Guide to Font Pairing](https://www.canva.com/learn/the-ultimate-guide-to-font-pairing/)

- **League Spartan** - for the main title and headings
- **Libre Baskerville** - for descriptive text
- with a backup font of **"Sans serif"**
